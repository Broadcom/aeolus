.SH DESCRIPTION 
The main purpose of this utility is to recompress and test
the zip archives to get the smallest possible size.
.PP
For recompression the 7\(hyZip (www.7\(hyzip.com) Deflate
implementation is used. This implementation generally
gives 5\(hy10% more compression than the zLib Deflate
implementation.
.PP
For experimental purpose also the 7\(hyZip LZMA algorithm is
available with the \(hyN option. In this case, the generated
zips WILL NOT BE USABLE by any other program. To make
them usable you need to recompress them without the \(hyN
option. Generally this algorithm gives 10\(hy20% more
compression than the 7\(hyZip Deflate implementation.
.SH OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \(hya, \(hy\(hyadd ARCHIVE FILES...
Create the specified archive with the specified
files. You must specify only one archive.
.TP
.B \(hyx, \(hy\(hyextract ARCHIVE
Extract all the files on the specified archive. You
must specify only one archive.
.TP
.B \(hyl, \(hy\(hylist ARCHIVES...
List the content of the specified archives.
.TP
.B \(hyz, \(hy\(hyrecompress ARCHIVES...
Recompress the specified archives. If the \(hy1, \(hy2,
\(hy3 options are specified, it\(cqs used the smallest file
choice from: the previous compressed data, the new
compression and the uncompressed format. If the \(hy0
option is specified the archive is always rewritten
without any compression.
.TP
.B \(hyt, \(hy\(hytest ARCHIVES...
Test the specified archives. The tests may be
extended with the \(hyp option.
.TP
.B \(hyN, \(hy\(hynot\(hyzip
Use the LZMA algorithm when compressing. The
generated zips will not be readable by any other
application!
.TP
.B \(hyp, \(hy\(hypedantic
Be pedantic on the zip tests. If this flag is
enabled some more extensive tests on the zip
integrity are done. These tests are generally not
done by other zip utilities.
.TP
.B \(hy0, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hystore
Disable the compression. The file is
only stored and not compressed. This option is
very useful to expand the archives of .png and .mp3
files. These files are already compressed, trying to
compress them another time is really a waste of time
and resource.
.TP
.B \(hy1, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyfast
Set the compression level to \(a"fast\(a".
.TP
.B \(hy2, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hynormal
Set the compression level to \(a"normal\(a". This is the
default level of compression.
.TP
.B \(hy3, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyextra
Set the compression level to \(a"extra\(a".
.TP
.B \(hy4, \(hy\(hyshrink\(hyinsane
Set the compression level to \(a"insane\(a".
