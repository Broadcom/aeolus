1 SYNOPSIS
==========

advdef [-z, --recompress] [-0, --shrink-store]
	[-1, --shrink-fast] [-2, --shrink-normal] [-3, --shrink-extra]
	[-4, --shrink-insane] [-f, --force] [-q, --quiet]
	[-h, --help] [-V, --version] FILES...


2 DESCRIPTION
=============

The main purpose of this utility is to recompress the
data present in the .png, .mng, .gz, .tgz and .svgz
files.

The internal structure of the files isn't changed.
Only the compressed data is modified.


3 OPTIONS
=========

    -z, --recompress FILES...
        Recompress the specified files. If the -1, -2, -3, -4
        options are specified it's used the smallest file
        choice from the previous compressed data and the
        new compression. If the -0 option is specified the
        file is always rewritten without any compression.

    -0, --shrink-store
        Disable the compression. The file is
        only stored and not compressed. The file is always
        rewritten also if it's bigger.

    -1, --shrink-fast
        Set the compression level to "fast".

    -2, --shrink-normal
        Set the compression level to "normal". This is the
        default level of compression.

    -3, --shrink-extra
        Set the compression level to "extra".

    -4, --shrink-insane
        Set the compression level to "insane". It's VERY
        SLOW.

    -f, --force
        Force the use of the new file also if it's bigger.


4 LIMITATIONS
=============

The advdef program cannot be used to recompress huge files
because it needs to allocate memory for both the complete
compressed and uncompressed data.
